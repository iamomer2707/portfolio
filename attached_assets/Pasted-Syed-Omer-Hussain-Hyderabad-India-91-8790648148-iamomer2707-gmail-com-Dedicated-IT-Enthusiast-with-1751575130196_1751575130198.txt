PROJECTS
Speech Enhancement using Residual CNN
This project focuses on improving the quality and intelligibility of speech signals by effectively suppressing noise and
distortions. Residual connections facilitate the learning of deeper network architectures, ensuring efficient feature extraction
and reconstruction of clean speech while preserving original signal characteristics.
Static Keystroke Dynamic Authentication (SKDA) Model
This project focuses on enhancing user authentication through static keystroke dynamics by incorporating non-conventional
features such as NumLock, Shift, and CapsLock keys. The aim is to capture and model these alternative inputs to improve
identity verification accuracy.
